### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * Or Install Node.js with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install node
    ```
2. Sauce Credentials
    * In the terminal export your Sauce Labs Credentials as environmental variables:
    ```
    $ export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your Sauce Labs username>
	$ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your Sauce Labs access key>
    ```
3. Project Dependencies
	* Install Node modules
	```
	$ npm install
	```
4. Install [saucie](https://github.com/igorlima/sauce-js-tests-integration) via `SAUCE_CONNECT_DOWNLOAD_ON_INSTALL=true npm install saucie -g`. If the SAUCE_CONNECT_DOWNLOAD_ON_INSTALL environment variable is not set then [sauce-connect-launcher will attempt to download it](https://github.com/bermi/sauce-connect-launcher#installation) on the first run which might prevent saucie from working if elevated privileges are not used.

### Running Tests

* Tests in Parallel:
	```
	$ npm test
	```

[Sauce Labs Dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/)

### Advice/Troubleshooting

1. There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs. Timeouts or Waits may need to be increased.
